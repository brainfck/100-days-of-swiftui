# TimeConverter
[100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) Day19 challenge project

# Your challenge
You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.

Time conversion: users choose seconds, minutes, hours, or days. \
If you were going for time conversion you might have:

A segmented control for seconds, minutes, hours, days, or years, for the input unit. \
A second segmented control for seconds, minutes, hours, days, or years, for the output unit. \
A text field where users enter a number. \
A text view showing the result of the conversion. \
So, if you chose seconds for source unit and minutes for output unit, then entered 60, youâ€™d see 1 as the output.
